# Clipboard-saver
Visual Basic .NET Windows Program for logging text copied into clipboard.

You can then save it all to text (.txt) file or recopy it again (if you wanted to recover text you had copied before).

Warning: this program works only when opened/running. It saves data in RAM, so the logged entires are lost if you close the program (unless you export them to text (.txt) file).

Tested and launched on: Windows Vista (32-bit VM), Windows 7 (32-bit), Windows 10 (64-bit).

To run the program or if it crashes, you may need to install .NET Framework 4 or newer. Link to .NET Framework 4 download:

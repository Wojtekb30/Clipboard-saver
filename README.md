# Clipboard-saver
Visual Basic Windows Program for logging text copied into clipboard.
You can then save it all to text (.txt) file or recopy it again (if you wanted to recover text you had copied before)
Warning: this program works only when open. It doesn't save data, so tle logged entires are lost if you close the program (unless you export them to text (.txt) file).
